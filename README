Sprites - Payment Channels that Go Faster than Lightning
=======

- contractDuplex.sol, test_duplex.sol:
   Simple duplex channel, based on the state channel pattern.

   Some simplifications:
   - while state channels can continue receiving on-chain input, contractDuplex reaches a terminal state after one trigger
   - withdrawals are encoded as monotonically increasing values, so no need to explicitly trigger an outputs

- contractSprite.sol, test_sprite.sol:
   A duplex channel with conditional (hashed timelock) payments, but that supports constant expiry times
